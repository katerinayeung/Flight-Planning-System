# ✈️ Flight Planning System

A backend-focused flight planning system project developed in **Java**, built as part of a semester-long software engineering course using a **plan-driven development process**.

## 🚀 Features
- Flight route planning based on user input 
- Auto-calculation of fuel usage, headings, time, and required refueling stops
- Custom databases for airports and airplanes with full CRUD operations
- Edge case handling for unreachable routes or lack of fuel facilities
- Structured documentation: class diagrams, data dictionary, test plans, and user manual
- Fully text-based — no UI, runs entirely in the console
